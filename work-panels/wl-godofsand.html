				I was selected among undergraduate and graduate applicants to collaborate on a digital game vertical slice in a multi-disciplinary game industry simulation course.

				As a programmer, my responsibilities included developing UI systems, enemy AI, game state architecture, and general feedback systems in Unity while working closely with producers, design leads, and other developers.

			<p>God of Sand is a third-person action platformer where the player uses a grappling hook to navigate a post-apocolyptic wasteland and defeat massive giants Ã  la <i>Shadow of the Colossus</i>.</p>
