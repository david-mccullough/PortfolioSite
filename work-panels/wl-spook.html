			<p>
				Board game designed and created for Game Design I at UTD. Spook! is a 4-player asymmetrical game about three trick-or-treaters who find themselves lost in a spooky forest on Halloween. One player plays as the forest itself, attempting to scare the humans to prevent them from finding their way out together. Only the forest has knowledge of the maze-like path toward the exit. Human players can only see the tile they are currently occupying, requiring communication and memory to locate each other while piecing together a mental map of the forest.
