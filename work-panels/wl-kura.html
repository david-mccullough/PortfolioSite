				Kura was created as part of a semester project assigned in the Systems Design course at UTD. Throughout the semester, I was tasked with continuously developing a GDD and respective game prototype while receiving weekly feedback from peers.
			</p>
			<p>Kura is an action platformer with roguelike elements about a ronin and his cursed relationship with a possessed katana. I learned a lot about pathfinding, procedural level generation, and utlity AI during this project.</p>
